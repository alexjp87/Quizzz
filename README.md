# Quizzz

## A Python project to practice object-oriented programming by building an educational tool for knowledge reinforcement based around the classic game Snake

### Project Goals
The aim of this project is to create a knowledge reinforcement tool for use in education, be it formal or self-taught.

The application will be based around the game Snake, incorporating some rule changes as well as quiz aspects.

I have personally found both knowledge checks and educational games to be of great help in reinforcing my learning, and I hope that this application can combine both of these things in a way that could be applied to reinforcing learning for any subject across almost any age group or level of experience.

Who doesn't enjoy Snake?!
