# Quizzz

## A Python project to practice object-oriented programming by building an educational tool for knowledge reinforcement based around the classic game Snake

### Project Goals
The aim of this project is to create a knowledge reinforcement tool for use in education, be it formal or self-taught.

The application will be based around the game Snake, incorporating some rule changes as well as quiz aspects.

I have personally found both knowledge checks and educational games to be of great help in reinforcing my learning, and I hope that this application can combine both of these things in a way that could be applied to reinforcing learning for any subject across almost any age group or level of experience.

Who doesn't enjoy Snake?!


### Agile Development

For this project I aim to develop using agile methodology, i.e. break the project down into phases.

Phase 1 will be building an object-oriented version of snake using a FreeCodeCamp tutorial via Youtube.

Then I aim to edit the code and implement one by one each of the features required for my application idea, with the design and implementation of each feature representing a new development phase.

- Sprint #1: snake tutorial
- Sprint #2: multi-snack functionality (branch: multi-snack)
- Sprint #3: prevent snacks overlapping functionality (branch: snack-overlap)

### User stories

From the perspective of the user:
- As a student, I want to have fun while I learn
- As a student, I want to learn in a visual way
- As a student, I want to use knowledge checks to reinforce my learning

From the perspective of the developer:
- As a beginner developer, I want to build something that will be useful in reinforcing learning
- As a beginner developer, I want to build something that will challenge me and help me improve my development skills
- As a beginner developer, I want to build something that combines education and fun
